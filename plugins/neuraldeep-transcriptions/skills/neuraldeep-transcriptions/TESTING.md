# Test-first verification

No billed endpoint was called during development or verification, and no audio
was transcribed. Publication is separate from these test results.

## Starting point

The repository started from the shared neuraldeep-* helper and suite at
neuraldeep-speechcore `5cc6ae3`, which includes the UTF-8 fix from `6e036b0`.
With `SERVICE = "whisper"`, the copied suite failed with `KeyError: 'whisper'`
in four helper tests, and the documentation tests failed because `SKILL.md`,
`README.md` and `STARTER_RELAY.md` did not exist yet.

## Red/green sequence

1. Added `tests/test_whisper.py` (7 tests) before changing the helper. All
   failed: `whisper` was not a known service, and the guard did not block it.
2. Added `SYNCHRONOUS = {"search", "whisper"}`, the `whisper` operation
   `transcribe`, the public price ID `whisper-1`, and fail-closed blocks in
   `guard()` and `submission()`. The shared state-path test now skips the
   `resume --job-id` case for every synchronous service, not only Search.
3. Added `test_resume_of_edited_resumable_state_is_blocked_not_crashed`. It
   failed: a hand-edited whisper state marked `submitted` came back `failed`.
   Search, in the same situation, skipped polling and raised `UnboundLocalError`
   on the undefined result. `resume` now refuses synchronous services before
   reading any state, and the post-submission branch checks `SYNCHRONOUS`.
4. Wrote the documentation; the documentation and fenced-example tests passed.

## Coverage added for whisper-1

- Service, operation and price ID match the public price list (`whisper-1`).
- The guard keeps the generic Starter, price and unit checks, then blocks with
  the unverified-quota reason.
- `check` makes exactly two read-only GETs: `/v1/limits` and public prices.
- `run` is blocked before any HTTP call or audio file read, leaving a
  `blocked` state and no artifact.
- `resume`, with `--job-id` or a saved state in any status, makes no request.
- SKILL.md and STARTER_RELAY.md name the real endpoint and the block.

## Live read-only evidence (2026-10-17)

- `GET /v1/models`: `whisper-1` has `type: transcription` and per-minute pricing.
- Public prices: `whisper-1` has `billing: minute`, `premium: false`.
- `GET /v1/limits`: only `chat` and `vector` buckets; nothing for audio.
- `GET /v1/audio/quota` and `GET /v1/audio/transcriptions/quota`: HTTP 404.
  `GET /v1/audio/diarize/quota` exists, but it belongs to diarization.
- `python3 -B scripts/client.py check transcribe` exited 1 with
  `whisper-1 remaining-quota endpoint unverified; transcription disabled`,
  so the Starter, subscription, key-status and non-premium checks passed live.

Only response structure was inspected. No account values are stored in this repository.

## Cross-review follow-up

A cross-review by three models (Claude Opus, gpt-6.1-sol, gemma-4-31b) found
no defect in the block itself, but several doc claims beyond the helper, and
one missing test. Each fix got a test first:

- The Search half of the resume fix had no test: with the guard narrowed to
  `SERVICE == "whisper"`, all 46 tests still passed while a mocked Search
  resume crashed. `test_resume_of_edited_resumable_state_is_blocked_not_crashed`
  from the shared suite (neuraldeep-speechcore `a16c7a4`) is now in
  `tests/test_client.py`; it fails on that narrowed guard and passes on the real one.
- `test_skill_does_not_advertise_what_the_helper_refuses` failed first.
  SKILL.md advertised transcription and a drop-in SDK replacement, claimed `run`
  read no files (it resolves the key and writes a `blocked` state file), and said
  "NeuralDeep GPUs", which the provider does not state for whisper-1.
- The documentation test now also requires STARTER_RELAY.md to say that only
  `check transcribe` reaches the network here. It must also describe the
  undocumented quota probes as probes. It failed before the guide was qualified.

## Malformed state and shared whisper tests

- Ported from neuraldeep-speechcore `a9a8073`: `resume` now blocks a state file
  that is not a dict, has a non-string `status` or a non-list `errors`, instead
  of crashing with `TypeError`. `test_resume_of_malformed_state_is_blocked_not_crashed`
  was added first and failed in all five cases.
- Three whisper tests now live in the shared `tests/test_client.py`, so the
  siblings get the same coverage: `test_whisper_is_blocked_without_verified_quota`,
  `test_whisper_is_synchronous_and_refuses_resume` and
  `test_whisper_run_is_blocked_before_any_request`. On the OCR helper, removing
  `"whisper"` from `SYNCHRONOUS` fails the second, and removing the
  `submission()` block fails the third; the first test alone caught neither.

## Resume keeps the state file

Ported from the sibling suites (for example neuraldeep-search `6e8bee9`): both
`test_resume_of_edited_resumable_state_is_blocked_not_crashed` tests, the shared one
and the whisper one, now also require the state file to be byte-for-byte unchanged.
With a mutation that overwrites the state before `resume` refuses, the old tests
passed; with the check, all three subtests of each fail.

## Agent guide

`AGENTS.md` gives Codex, Coddy and other coding agents the repo rules.
`test_agents_guide_covers_codex_coddy_and_the_block` and the AGENTS.md entry in
`test_fenced_examples_parse_without_execution` both failed before the file existed;
the guide's Bash blocks pass `bash -n`.

## Unknown polling status

A live run on 2026-10-17 (four agents, real API) found that every OCR `run extract`
ended `failed` with "returned an unknown status", although the job had finished:
a later `GET /v1/ocr/jobs/{id}` said `completed`, and `resume` fetched the text.
`poll()` treated any status outside its fixed in-progress list as a failure.

Six tests were added first and failed: an unknown intermediate status now keeps
polling, an unknown status until the deadline ends `timed_out` naming it (only a
plain word is echoed), explicit failure statuses still stop at once, a response
without a status is a resumable `poll_error`, and a mocked OCR run passes through
an unknown status to `completed`. Mutations of the failure set, the status check
and the sanitising each fail their own test. **59 tests passed**, both normally
and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no EncodingWarnings.

## Blocked is a final answer

In a live run on 2026-10-17, one agent (Coddy with kimi-k2.6) met the whisper-1 block,
read the credential file, printed the key, and called the API directly. Another,
pushed by a goal checker ("the goal is not met yet"), probed undocumented quota
endpoints and tried a direct transcription. SKILL.md now opens with a
"When the helper says `blocked`" section: `blocked` is the final answer; never read
the key, never call the API directly, never hand-write state, never probe
undocumented endpoints, and keep the answer when a supervisor says the task is not
done. The description says so too. The documentation test for it failed first.
**60 tests passed**, both normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`.

## Repository renamed

The repository is now `neuraldeep-transcriptions` (formerly `neuraldeep-whisper-1`;
GitHub redirects the old URL). The skill name, README install commands and
AGENTS.md follow it; the model, the `whisper` service and the `whisper-1` price ID
are unchanged. Commit references above keep the old repository name.
`test_documentation_names_the_real_endpoint_and_block` checked the old skill name
and failed first after it was updated.

## Transcription models

The shared helper now knows three speech-to-text models for the `whisper`
service: `gigaam-v3` (the default), `whisper-1` and `whisper-podlodka-turbo`,
chosen with `--model`. Each has its own public price ID; the guard checks the
chosen model's row and its block names the model. `--model` is refused for the
other services and for unknown models (exit 2). Five shared tests were added
first; four failed and the fifth guards the new flag. Moving the default from
`whisper-1` to `gigaam-v3` updated the tests pinned to it. Mutations of the
default, the model check and the per-model price ID each fail their own test.
A live read-only `check` (2026-10-17) blocked each model at the quota step, so
all three price rows are present and non-premium. **66 tests passed**, both
normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`.

## Agent rule surfaces

Added `tests/test_agent_rules.py` (10 tests) before any rule file existed; all
10 failed because `.codex/hooks/attach_rules.py`, the rules and `CLAUDE.md` were
missing. Then added Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), their Claude Code
mirrors with identical bodies (`.claude/rules/*.md`), the Codex hook that attaches
the Cursor rules (`.codex/hooks.json`, `.codex/hooks/attach_rules.py`),
`CLAUDE.md` as a symlink to `AGENTS.md`, and the Delivery workflow and Rules Sync
sections in `AGENTS.md`. The tests check the pairing and scope mapping, that
every glob matches a file, and the hook itself: always-on rules at session start,
the client rule once per session for patch add, update, delete and rename and for
`Edit` and `Write`, and fail-open on bad input. Eight mutations (a widened or
narrowed scope, `paths` differing from `globs`, body drift, a missing mirror, a
dead glob, `.codex/rules.md`, a copied `CLAUDE.md`) each failed a test. The test
file and `.codex/hooks/` are identical across the neuraldeep-* repositories.
**76 tests passed**, both normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no
`EncodingWarning` under `-X warn_default_encoding`.

## Release metadata (v1.0.0)

Added `tests/test_release.py` (3 tests, identical across the neuraldeep-*
repositories) first. Two failed: `SKILL.md` had no `metadata.version` and
`AGENTS.md` had no release steps; the tag check is skipped outside a tag build.
`metadata.version: 1.0.0` is now in the `SKILL.md` frontmatter, the key Coddy
reads (`coddy skills list` showed `1.0.0` for a copy under a scratch
`CODDY_HOME`), and `AGENTS.md` has a Releases section. With
`GITHUB_REF_TYPE=tag`, `GITHUB_REF_NAME=v1.0.0` passed and `v1.0.1` failed.
**79 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with
`LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`.

## Final results

- `python3 -X warn_default_encoding -B -m unittest discover -s tests`:
  **79 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), 0 EncodingWarnings.
- The same suite under `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`: passed.
- `python3 -B scripts/client.py --help`: passed, with no network call.
- Fenced Python examples parsed with `ast.parse`; Bash examples passed `bash -n`.

## Diarization service

Port from neuraldeep-diarization: the shared helper now knows the `diarize`
service (`POST /v1/audio/diarize`, price ID `audio:diarize`). Its quota at
`/v1/audio/diarize/quota` reports `used` and `limit` minutes per `day` and
`month`, verified read-only on 2026-10-18, and the guard requires `limit - used`
to cover `--minutes`, at most 240, with files of at most 500 MB. An offline
`merge` command joins a diarization with a timed transcript. `--minutes` and
`merge` are refused for the other services (exit 2), and this service's
behaviour is unchanged. The 16 shared tests and the merge case of the UTF-8 test
were added first and failed with `KeyError: 'diarize'` and the missing
`merge_transcript`. `SKILL.md` now points to the neuraldeep-diarization skill, whose `merge` consumes this endpoint's timed transcripts. `STARTER_RELAY.md` lists the diarization bucket.
**95 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with
`LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`.

## Diarization formats and cross-review fixes

Port from neuraldeep-diarization. `merge --format json|vtt|srt|rttm` writes
WebVTT with voice tags, SRT with a speaker prefix, or RTTM converted locally
from the diarization alone. A cross-review of the diarization skill led to
shared fixes, each with a test written first:
- the diarization POST waits `max(120, 30 * minutes)` s;
- every service's `run` checks `--output` before any request, so an output
  equal to `--file` or in a missing directory blocks instead of overwriting the
  input or losing a paid answer;
- subtitle speaker labels are flattened, and the 1 ms cue minimum applies after
  rounding;
- `finite()` rejects integers too large for a float;
- `merge` sorts its inputs by time and compares overlaps to the microsecond;
- the 500 MB cap is tested.
`STARTER_RELAY.md` documents the output check, and this service is otherwise
unchanged. The 15 new shared tests failed first, apart from the flag-rule and
cap tests, which only add coverage.
**110 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with
`LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`.

## Second cross-review fixes

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `e376732`. `run` now also blocks an
`--output` that is a directory, and checks the unresolved parent that
`atomic_write()` uses, so a symlink in a read-only directory blocks too.
WebVTT and SRT get one cue per transcript segment, through `label_segments()`.
Huge timestamps and deeply nested input JSON end `blocked`. `merge` parses
input bytes, accepting a UTF-8 byte order mark, and names a file that is not
valid JSON. The new and changed shared tests failed first, apart from the
read-only and missing directory cases, which already passed.
**115 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with
`LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`.

## Third cross-review fixes

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `e4bdae5`. `run` requires read, write and
search permission on the output directory, since `atomic_write()` needs all
three. `merge` decodes strict UTF-8 (a byte order mark is fine), so UTF-16,
UTF-32 and surrogate bytes block; a missing input, an unwritable output and a
lone surrogate escape block with their own messages. `--output` equal to
`--diarization` is tested. The new shared tests failed first, apart from that
coverage case. **117 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both
normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`.

## Fourth cross-review fixes

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `336ccf4`. The output check uses
`os.path.isdir()`, because `Path.is_dir()` raises `PermissionError` on Python
3.10 to 3.12 and broke the 3.10 CI job; `run` blocks replacing another user's
file in a sticky directory before any request; the RTTM file ID shows
non-UTF-8 file name bytes as U+FFFD; a tie test has the first speaker last in
alphabetical order. The sticky-directory and file-name tests failed first.
**120 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with
`LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`,
non-root, no network).

## Fifth cross-review fixes

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `49688de`. `run` blocks an output name the
file system refuses (any `lstat` error except `FileNotFoundError`), and the
`run` and `merge` same-file checks add `os.path.samefile()` for hard links and
case aliases. `--format rttm` blocks a lone surrogate speaker label with its own
message, and the diarization artifact is written with ASCII escapes. The new
shared tests failed first. **124 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build),
both normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`,
non-root, no network).

## Sixth cross-review fixes

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `5916a17`. An output that is the state file
through a case alias blocks once the state exists, before any request; a new
output name is created with `O_EXCL` and removed before the preflight, so names
vfat, exFAT or SMB refuse on create block early; consecutive unassigned merge
segments stay separate turns. The new shared tests failed first.
**127 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with
`LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`,
non-root, no network).

## Seventh cross-review fix

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `c10a179`. Once the state exists, `run`
blocks an input file that is the state file, also through a case alias, before
any request; before, `--file x --state x` with no `x` sent the helper's own
state JSON. The new shared test failed first. **128 tests passed** (1 skipped
outside a tag build), both normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no
`EncodingWarning` under `-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22
(Docker `python:3.10-slim`, non-root, no network).

## Eighth cross-review fixes

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `14c0056`. The U+FFFD repair for non-UTF-8
file names applies to the RTTM file ID only, so speaker labels with lone
surrogates block as in the other formats instead of merging; the
input-is-the-state test also covers a dangling symlink. The new RTTM test
failed first. **129 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both
normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`,
non-root, no network).

## Streamed uploads

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `3b918a7`. `multipart()` returns an
`UploadBody` that `http.client` reads in 8 KB blocks with a normal
`Content-Length`, so the socket timeout bounds each block, not the whole
upload, and no copy of the file is held in memory; exactly the checked size is
sent. The provider documents no chunked or resumable upload, so a broken upload
is never resent. `UPLOAD_LIMITS` keeps only documented limits (diarize
500 MB); this service documents none. The shared multipart tests read the body
with `drain()`. The new shared tests failed first. **133 tests passed**
(1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`,
with no `EncodingWarning` under `-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python
3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`, non-root, no network).

## Uploads opened before any request

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `4c7979f`. `multipart()` opens the input with
`O_NONBLOCK`, takes the size from `fstat()` on the open file and refuses
anything but a regular file, so an unreadable file, a directory or a FIFO
blocks before the preflight instead of failing mid-upload as a false
`reconciliation_required`; `execute()` closes a body that was never sent. The
docs now say 8 KB blocks, `http.client`'s block size. The new shared
tests failed first. **135 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both
normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`,
non-root, no network).

## Blocking upload reads

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `5e03e41`. `multipart()` clears `O_NONBLOCK`
with `os.set_blocking()` after the regular-file check, because some FUSE or
network file systems honour the flag on reads, which would look like a
shrinking file after the POST started. The new shared test failed first.
**136 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with
`LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`,
non-root, no network).

## Per-skill keys from Coddy's environment

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `52f2d5c`. The helper reads this skill's own
`NEURALDEEP_TRANSCRIPTIONS_API_KEY`, then the shared `NEURALDEEP_API_KEY`, each from the environment first,
then from `${CODDY_HOME}/.env`, parsed with the rules of Coddy's loader, so a
key added there works without a restart. A value may hold several keys
separated by commas; the first whose free preflight passes is used, and the
state records its variable and number, never its value, so `resume` uses the
same key. The Coddy provider file `neuraldeep-auth.json` is no longer read.
The docs ask the user to add the key to `~/.coddy/.env`, never in the chat; the
test commands and CI also blank `NEURALDEEP_TRANSCRIPTIONS_API_KEY`. The new shared tests failed first, and
every helper test now patches `resolve_keys`. **140 tests passed** (1 skipped
outside a tag build), both normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no
`EncodingWarning` under `-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22
(Docker `python:3.10-slim`, non-root, no network).

## Explained API errors

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `9c19350`. An HTTP error now reads
`HTTP <code> (<fixed hint>)` for every status the provider documents (400, 401,
408, 422, 429, 500, 502, 503), with `retry after N s` and `window session|week`
only for well-formed `Retry-After` and `X-Window` values; the provider's body and
reason text are still never shown. SKILL.md has an "Error handling" table of
these statuses, keeping this service's own notes, and a shared test keeps it in
step with `ERROR_HINTS`. The three new shared tests failed first.
**143 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with
`LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`,
non-root, no network).

## .env read as bytes

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `69cedbd`. `read_dotenv()` decodes
`${CODDY_HOME}/.env` with replacement, so one non-UTF-8 byte no longer hides
every key in it, as in Coddy's line-by-line read; the Error handling table says
the key may be in the environment or `~/.coddy/.env`; a cap test closes the
upload files it opens. The new shared tests failed first. **144 tests passed**
(1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`,
with no `EncodingWarning` under `-X warn_default_encoding`, no `ResourceWarning`
under `-W always::ResourceWarning`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker
`python:3.10-slim`, non-root, no network).

## Non-regular outputs and the 401 row

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `0cf376e`. `run` blocks, before any request,
an existing `--output` that is a FIFO, socket or device (also behind a
symlink), which `atomic_write()` would replace after the paid request; a
dangling symlink is still replaced like a missing file. The 401 row of the
Error handling table asks the user to check the key and tells the agent never
to read `~/.coddy/.env` itself. The new shared tests failed first.
**145 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and with
`LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`,
non-root, no network).

## Paying from the wallet

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `21542cd`. A key in wallet mode can pay, but
only with the user's approval: a wallet key skips the subscription quota and
gets an estimate (quota units x the public price, rounded up to kopecks),
checked against the wallet balance and the key's spending cap; subscription keys
are preferred; without `--wallet-limit` (the roubles the user approved) `check`
and `run` end `wallet_approval_required` with the estimate and nothing sent. In this skill the submission stays disabled, also from the wallet.
The subscription guard names the failing condition. SKILL.md has a "Paying from
the wallet" section, AGENTS.md forbids `--wallet-limit` without the user's
approval, and STARTER_RELAY.md lists the new status. The new shared tests failed
first. **154 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and
with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`,
non-root, no network).

## Wallet-paid transcription and SpeechCore uploads

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `309f18a`. With a wallet key and the user's
approval (`--wallet-limit`) the shared helper now posts `file` and `model` to
`/v1/audio/transcriptions` and validates the synchronous answer, or posts the
file to SpeechCore's `/upload` and polls the job; subscription keys stay blocked
at the guard, since neither service has a verified remaining-quota endpoint.
`--minutes` is required for every minute-billed service, and the wallet warning
names the price row's output-token rate when it has one. This skill's SKILL.md, README.md, AGENTS.md, STARTER_RELAY.md and `client` rule now describe wallet transcription; `tests/test_whisper.py` now checks that a subscription run sends nothing and a wallet check asks for approval, and its documentation tests failed first.
The new shared tests failed first. **159 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag
build), both normally and with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning`
under `-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker
`python:3.10-slim`, non-root, no network).

## Missing home directory

Port from neuraldeep-diarization `03eb992`. When no home directory can be
determined, `resolve_keys()` treats it as "no .env" and the CLI prints the
blocked envelope instead of a traceback. The Codex section of AGENTS.md names the environment and `${CODDY_HOME:-~/.coddy}/.env` instead of `~/.coddy`. The new shared test failed
first. **160 tests passed** (1 skipped outside a tag build), both normally and
with `LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0`, with no `EncodingWarning` under
`-X warn_default_encoding`, and on Python 3.10.22 (Docker `python:3.10-slim`,
non-root, no network).

## Release metadata (v2.0.0)

`metadata.version` is now 2.0.0, a major release under semantic versioning,
because the key source changed incompatibly: the helper no longer reads the
Coddy provider file `providers/neuraldeep/neuraldeep-auth.json`, only this
skill's own variable and the shared `NEURALDEEP_API_KEY` from the environment or
`${CODDY_HOME:-~/.coddy}/.env`; a key kept only in the provider file must be
added to `.env`. The other changes since v1.0.0 add features: the diarize
service and its formats, streamed uploads with documented size limits,
explained API errors, wallet billing with the user's approval, and wallet-paid
transcription and SpeechCore uploads. `tests/test_release.py` passes; the tag
check runs on the `v2.0.0` tag build after the merge.

## README and agent-rule verification (2026-10-26)

Added the shared README contract and stronger native-rule checks before the documentation and configuration fixes. The initial runs failed on missing README sections and host details, missing fork matching and incomplete new-family workflow guidance. A further failing recovery-guide test caught obsolete claims about wallet transcription and SpeechCore uploads.

The full source suite passed on Python 3.14.4 in normal, C-locale and encoding-warning modes. Each mode ran **170 tests with 1 expected non-tag skip**. No EncodingWarning was emitted. The runner supplied PATH, HOME and TMPDIR in a cleared environment, a nonexistent CODDY_HOME and no NeuralDeep credentials. It invoked these commands from the source root.

```bash
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests
LC_ALL=C PYTHONUTF8=0 python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests
python3 -X warn_default_encoding -B -m unittest discover -s tests
python3 -B scripts/client.py --help
git diff --check
```

The README CLI examples passed argument parsing without operation execution. Fenced Bash examples passed `bash -n`. New-family JSON examples passed the pure planner. All Python files parsed with the Python 3.10 grammar. This is a syntax check, not a local Python 3.10 runtime claim. The source workflow was included in the successful actionlint check of all 16 source and collection workflows.

Tests check the CLAUDE.md symlink, Cursor and Claude rule parity and scopes, Codex session and edit payloads, deduplication, fork resets and fail-open behavior. These are offline adapter checks, not confirmation of native host UI context loading. Interactive Codex `/hooks` approval was not performed. A collection-level native CLI probe was attempted but did not complete.

Guarded helper hashes are unchanged. No live skill API call, paid skill submission, global provider or MCP change, release or PR merge was performed for this documentation verification.
